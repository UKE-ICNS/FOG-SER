# Deep brain stimulation on cortico-subcortical networks in Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients with freezing of gait, SER model.

This is a repository for the project to model the effect of deep brain stimulation on cortico-subcortical networks of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Here, we focus on one particular symptom of PD, freezing of gait (FoG).

To analyse all the emerging attractors in the FoG network under the SER dynamics, use the "main.py" file. The file will use some functions from the "funcs.py". 
The SER model is in the "SER.py". Before that, install the "ser.yml" environment. 

All of the figures could be saved in the "Animations" folder. All the attractor data will be saved into the "Files" folder.
